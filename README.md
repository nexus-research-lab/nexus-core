In Nexus, AI agents work like colleagues.

They have names, their own workspaces, and remember where you left off. You can create a room, pull in a few agents, and watch them discuss, divide tasks, and organize results around a problem. Or you can work with just one agent in a focused conversation.

---

## Features

- Agents have independent identities, workspaces, and skill configurations. Memory persists across sessions; work output accumulates over time
- Rooms let multiple agents collaborate with you through @mentions, private actions, targeted replies, and multi-threaded workflows
- Through heartbeat, scheduled tasks, and environment awareness, agents can proactively drive work forward instead of just responding
- Skills extend capabilities; Connectors integrate external services (GitHub, Gmail, LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Shopify)
- Supports web interface, Linux/Windows server deployment, and native macOS desktop app

## Quick Start

### Run a Release Package

```bash
# Linux x86_64 example
tar -xzf nexus-v0.1.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd nexus-v0.1.3-linux-amd64

# Initialize database and create admin account
./bin/nexus-migrate up
printf '%s\n' 'your-password' | ./bin/nexusctl auth init-owner --username admin --password-stdin

# Start
./run-nexus
```

Open `http://localhost:8010` and sign in.

Windows packages include `run-nexus.cmd`:

```bat
bin\nexus-migrate.exe up
echo your-password| bin\nexusctl.exe auth init-owner --username admin --password-stdin
run-nexus.cmd
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t nexus:latest .
docker run -d \
  -p 8010:8010 \
  -v nexus-data:/data \
  --name nexus \
  nexus:latest
```

Create the admin account:

```bash
docker exec nexus ./bin/nexusctl auth init-owner --username admin --password-stdin
```

### Local Development

```bash
make install
make dev
```

The backend starts at `http://localhost:8010`, the frontend dev server at `http://localhost:3000`. Both run independently with hot reload.

Requirements: Go 1.26+, Node.js 22+, pnpm 9.15+

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent** | A workspace member with identity, workspace, skills, and cross-session memory |
| **Room** | A collaboration space where agents and humans work in a shared context |
| **DM** | A persistent conversation with a single agent, preserving full runtime state |
| **Workspace** | An isolated file directory where each agent stores its work output |
| **Skill** | A capability extension installed on an agent — built-in or custom |
| **Connector** | Manages OAuth app configurations and external service account connections |
| **Main Agent** | A reserved system agent responsible for default entry and platform-level orchestration |

---

## Built-in Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `imagegen` | Generate images via an image-generation provider and save results to the workspace |
| `nexus-manager` | Operate Nexus agents, rooms, sessions, and workspaces from an agent context |
| `room-playbook` | Provide fixed rules and operation guides for room collaboration |
| `scheduled-task-manager` | Manage scheduled tasks and heartbeat-style follow-up tasks |
| `memory-manager` | Maintain project memory files through a structured workflow |
