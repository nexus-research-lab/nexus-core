# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Changed Agent creation and renaming so `agent_id` is the identity anchor and Agent names are display labels that can be reused.
- Removed window controller/observer session-control behavior from chat sessions; bound clients now receive permission and session-status events without a primary-window role, and composer attachment hints are shorter.
- Changed Room communication to use built-in `nexus_room` runtime tools instead of `nexusctl` Bash calls, removing the old Room message send/publish CLI control path.
- Tightened chat message typography and spacing for narrow workspace columns.
- Added a collapsible left sidebar that auto-collapses on narrow screens while right-side panels are open.

### Fixed
- Fixed built-in Provider settings so preset API format and Provider kind are derived internally instead of exposed as selectable controls.
- Fixed Agent deletion so removed Agents are hard-deleted with dependent database rows, preventing stale archived records from blocking name reuse.
- Fixed DM runtime startup so stale SDK resume IDs are cleared and retried once instead of leaving the client disconnected.
- Fixed group Thread opening while history, workspace, or about panels are active.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- Added DingTalk AI Tables, Tencent Docs, Yuque, DiDi, and AMap connectors, with remote MCP, token header, stdio token, or official MCP key configuration and runtime MCP mounting for Agents.
- Added DashScope and ModelScope provider presets with dedicated image-generation API formats; DashScope supports Anthropic Messages, Responses, and Chat Completions, while ModelScope supports Chat Completions.
- Added Skill community discovery and import from built-in sources, configurable JSON indexes, Git repositories, URLs, zip archives, and local files, with persisted source and import metadata.
- Added `nexusctl skill` support for external source search, Git import, one-shot external import/install, and imported Skill updates.

### Changed
- Refined Room collaboration around a minimal directed-message kernel: public Rooms advance through public `@` mentions, while private and small-group work use explicit `recipients`, `wake_policy`, and `reply_route`.
- Removed the standalone `nexus-migrate` binary and manual migration subcommands; database migration and Docker owner bootstrap now run through `nexus-server`, and frontend protocol generation uses `go generate ./internal/protocol`.
- Consolidated Skill import into a single dialog with source management, Git branch/path fields, local zip import, `SKILL.md` guidance, and Room Skill `scope: room` guidance.
- Changed `skills.sh` imports to clone the backing GitHub repository and import the selected Skill directory directly instead of depending on `pnpm dlx skills add`.
- Improved runtime MCP tool handling, connector credential flows, and service startup initialization, while reducing successful static asset and read-only request log noise.

### Fixed
- Fixed Room directed-message handbacks and public-feed wake-up routing so coordinators can return to the public flow through `next_reply_route`.
- Fixed DM and Room runtime fallback to the default chat model, escaped slashes in Provider model IDs, the GLM model list endpoint, and default model population for newly configured desktop-mode Providers.
- Fixed Provider configuration, Connector status, external Skill registry data, and summary counts so they are correctly scoped in multi-user deployments.
- Fixed Agent Skill dynamic discovery, `skills.sh`/Git/URL Skill import stability, external Skill search triggering, and temporary-directory-based naming.
- Fixed production copy failures and added clipboard fallback handling.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Added General settings roles for the default chat model, default image-generation model, and background task model, with background tasks such as title generation preferring the background task model.
- Added Custom Provider configuration, synchronization, and testing for Chat Completions, Responses, and Anthropic Messages, and exposed the OpenAI preset configuration.
- Added explicit `--provider` and `--model` overrides to `nexusctl imagegen`.

### Changed
- Refactored Provider default model selection and the lightweight LLM call path, while keeping the default chat model limited to Provider models supported by the current Agent runtime.
- Fixed built-in Provider Base URL and Models Path handling to use the built-in catalog, while the settings page shows Base URLs for all preset API formats and Custom Providers can still use custom endpoints.
- Aligned Agent prompt runtime context and workspace templates so built-in runtime constraints, default models, and tool usage guidance stay consistent.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing Skill selector title, excessive member list height, and oversized bottom spacing in the Room management dialog.
- Fixed Room member selection clicks.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Refactored Provider configuration and default model selection: defaults now use explicit Provider + Model choices, Provider pages have complete localization, built-in Providers include Qwen Token Plan, MiniMax Token Plan, and Volcengine Coding Plan, and runtime no longer depends on the legacy `is_default` and `model` columns.
- Expanded long-running scheduled tasks with script execution, explicit member execution, run artifacts, stuck-run recovery, daily reports, per-task status, management events, history search, CLI operations, and runtime timeout watchdogs.
- Refined scheduled-task result delivery to support DM, Room, Agent inbox, Feishu, and other IM group destinations, with delivery ledgers, automatic retry, dead letters, manual redelivery, and historical traceability after task deletion.
- Allowed Feishu and external IM inbound messages to create, inspect, update, disable, delete, and redeliver scheduled tasks directly, backed by idempotent ledgers, signature validation, owner context, and managed Skills for observable and recoverable background handling.
- Added DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX workspace file previews, and improved Office preview layout, zooming, sidebar placeholders, PPTX master placeholders, and text style restoration.
- Added local user avatar settings for the desktop app, and added Windows update-check release notes.
- Added Codex built-in Skill reference analysis documentation to clarify reusable Nexus Skill ecosystem capabilities and implementation priorities.

### Fixed
- Fixed SQLite legacy migration startup failures, migration number conflicts, server single-file migration references, and test stability issues.
- Added an internal `[cron:...]` marker for scheduled-task trigger messages so the chat timeline hides automation-generated user trigger bubbles.
- Fixed scheduled task HTTP create/edit requests not accepting `execution_kind`, which caused page-created script tasks to be treated as Agent tasks by the backend.
- Fixed temporary Claude scheduling tools potentially accepting user reminders; reminders and long-running tasks now consistently require Nexus persistent scheduled tasks.
- Fixed Office file preview layout, table preview enlarged sidebar placeholders, XLSX zoom range, PPTX display, and PPTX text style restoration.
- Fixed the chat sidebar delete confirmation staying open after a failed delete request.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Added full Feishu Cloud Docs connector capabilities: user-managed OAuth Client configuration, callback URL copy, document read/create/append/block update, cloud space and knowledge base browsing, full-text search, Sheet reads, and Bitable record viewing.
- Added user-level memory management and Agent memory entry points, with search, filters, deletion, dirty-data cleanup, orphan session summaries, and checkpoint cleanup in contact details and the Memory page.
- Added deferred-loading metadata for MCP tools so connector and automation tools can return tool descriptions and input schemas on demand, reducing default context usage.
- Added Agent contact views so contact details and Room member panels can show DMs, requests, private notes, and small-scope record projections.

### Changed
- Refactored the web design system around shared Button, Dialog, Panel, SelectMenu, Avatar, ListRow, Badge, StateBlock, FormControl, Tabs, and related components, removing unused legacy components and excess Liquid Glass shells.
- Unified capability information architecture: connectors, Skills, message channels, pairing authorization, scheduled tasks, and memory pages now use lightweight directories, unified search and filters, detail pages, and consistent dialogs and empty states.
- Refined Feishu connector configuration by moving connector details from dialogs to secondary pages and reusing unified Dialog and Panel components for OAuth Client configuration and Device Flow authorization.
- Improved the DM/Room workspace with Safari-style conversation tabs, direct access from Room avatars to Agent contact information, and simplified new/manage Room dialogs with single-list selection.
- Improved Markdown streaming by delaying links for trailing URLs, tightening external-link protocol allowlists, and shortening displayed bare URLs.
- Unified page width, buttons, inputs, dropdowns, loading skeletons, and status feedback across settings, Agent configuration, scheduled tasks, memory, and capability pages.

### Fixed
- Fixed access logs potentially leaking query parameters such as `access_token`, `token`, and `api_key`, and added regression coverage.
- Fixed backend stability issues around WebSocket Origin validation, startup panics, file descriptor soft limits, session title refreshes, and Room public-feed projection coloring.
- Fixed OAuth callback windows not auto-closing after authorization success, connector lists not always refreshing, and overly broad nginx callback routing.
- Fixed help center close buttons, failed delete-session confirmation states, permission dropdown clipping, and file references being unclickable before the first workspace was opened.
- Fixed image generation landing in the wrong directory, oversized chat image previews, ordered-list marker overlap, automatic memory submission triggers, and low-value task memory extraction.

### Security
- Fixed the PostCSS security advisory GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93, and tightened WebSocket Origin checks and access-log redaction.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added a "Check for Updates" entry to the Windows desktop tray menu, allowing manual GitHub Release checks, downloads, and sha256-verified installation.

### Changed
- Made `make app-win-build` use the current timestamp as the Windows desktop app build number by default for local testing with uncommitted changes; `APP_WIN_BUILD_NUMBER` can still override it.
- Reduced GitHub `Publish Release` assets to macOS DMGs, Windows installers, and required sha256/metadata files, no longer uploading custom source archives, Linux/Windows binary packages, or Windows portable zips.
- Changed Windows desktop packaging scripts to prefer installers and locally produce only installer, sha256, and metadata artifacts by default.
- Refined Memory scheduling and API tests to improve regression coverage for dynamic recall, checkpoints, and HTTP APIs.
- Changed the Windows desktop app close button to hide the main window to the system tray; full exit now uses the tray icon context menu.
- Restyled the Windows desktop tray menu with a title, sections, and hover highlighting.

### Fixed
- Fixed onboarding completion state being lost on every Windows/macOS desktop launch when the sidecar local port changed.
- Fixed Nexus or DM entry clicks not opening the most recently active conversation.
- Fixed duplicate storage for the same attachment during send.
- Fixed Windows desktop auto-update checks writing the 24-hour throttle state before requests, causing failed checks to suppress later startup checks.
- Fixed Windows desktop Nexus motion being fully reduced to static text when system animation effects were disabled, and logged the reduced-motion state at startup for diagnosis.
- Fixed lingering Windows desktop shell and sidecar processes after closing the main window, which could block overwriting `.build/app/Nexus` during the next temporary build.
- Fixed Agent startup failures returning only generic WebSocket internal errors without Claude Code or Provider configuration guidance.
- Fixed Windows Agent runtime initialization when Claude Code installed through npm only exposes `claude.cmd` instead of `claude.exe`.
- Fixed Windows desktop log export failures caused by file-sharing locks on active sidecar log files.
- Fixed Windows WebView2 WebSocket handshakes being rejected with 401 when the `nexus_desktop_token` cookie was not written.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Added Nexus Memory v1 with local Markdown source of truth, automatic dynamic recall, candidate promotion, checkpoint deduplication, `nexusctl memory` commands, HTTP APIs, and a Web Memory panel.
- Added a notification loop after chat message completion: inactive windows can trigger browser system notifications, the left chat entry and conversation rows show unread completed-message counts, and counts clear automatically when entering the conversation.
- Added workspace file previews for Markdown, HTML, Mermaid, images, SVG, PDF, and plain text, with unified download entries in the preview area, chat file cards, and file context menu.
- Added GitHub OAuth Device Flow to the desktop app: release packages inject only the public Client ID, and the local sidecar polls and stores the token after the user enters the GitHub authorization code.
- Made desktop local mode skip account login by default and protect sidecar APIs through a native-shell-injected local session token.

### Changed
- Made `make logs`, `make logs-all`, and `make logs-nginx` show the latest 1000 lines by default for easier startup log inspection.
- Removed extra bridge SDK accessibility prechecks from the Makefile; installation, migration, protocol generation, and release package builds now rely directly on the Go module toolchain to validate dependencies.
- Removed frontend OAuth App self-configuration for connectors; the backend environment or desktop built-in configuration now decides whether connectors are available.
- Improved Markdown and preview streaming by separating stable blocks from streaming tails, aligning unclosed code fences to actual content, keeping the previous valid SVG for streaming Mermaid previews, skipping full highlighting during streaming code blocks, and reducing HTML preview reload jitter through head-readiness and throttled commits.
- Improved Markdown table rendering by correcting the formula/GFM table parse order and letting wide tables scroll inside their own container.
- Improved Markdown list rendering by fixing paragraph blocks that forced list-item content onto a new line after the marker.
- Improved Markdown text rendering with safe inline text tags, `<br>` line breaks, and better paragraph wrapping.
- Improved Mermaid SVG rendering with unified edge-label backgrounds, node radius, note colors, and diamond-node rounding.

### Fixed
- Fixed identifiers such as `Cron*(...)` in Markdown being misparsed as emphasis markers.
- Fixed workspace file editor/preview toolbar clicks on text regions triggering editor blur first and causing view jumps.
- Fixed workspace file status sometimes staying in "writing" after an Agent task ended.
- Fixed user message text not aligning by sender direction inside right-side bubbles.
- Fixed attachment preview paths becoming invalid after refresh when opening a user attachment accidentally focused the file tree on the internal `.nexus/attachments` directory.
- Fixed image attachments being sent to the runtime only as `@"path"` text, making first-turn image understanding unreliable, and aligned image content blocks to Claude Code `source.base64`.
- Fixed chat unread counts being stored only globally, missing from conversation rows, and not opening the corresponding unread conversation on click.
- Fixed the Windows installer incorrectly rejecting Windows 11 ARM64 running in x64 compatibility mode because of Inno Setup architecture constraints.
- Fixed desktop chat, sidebar subscription, and completion-notification WebSocket connections not carrying the desktop session token, causing local sidecar rejection.
- Removed GitHub OAuth Client Secret injection from desktop release packages to avoid exposing confidential client secrets in distributed artifacts.
- Fixed macOS Dock re-open resetting the current workspace route to the launcher.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Added the Windows desktop update download/install flow: a 24-hour-throttled GitHub Release metadata check can download `NexusSetup-*.exe` and sha256 files, verify them, and then prompt to launch the installer.
- Added Windows desktop Inno Setup installers to the release flow, producing `NexusSetup-<version>-<build>.exe`, sha256 files, Start Menu entries, optional desktop shortcuts, and `nexus://` protocol registration.
- Added the Nexus app icon to the Windows desktop app so packaged `Nexus.exe` displays an independent app icon.
- Added a native macOS "Check for Updates..." menu item that performs a 24-hour-throttled background GitHub Release check and prompts the user to open the download page when a new version is available.
- Added the first-stage Windows desktop WPF/WebView2 shell with Go sidecar launch, random local ports, runtime config injection, full launcher default entry, single-instance wake-up, `nexus://` routing, DPAPI credential keys, basic desktop bridge, diagnostic export, smoke scripts, zip/metadata packaging, and GitHub Release app asset upload.
- Added paste-image support to the conversation input and support for uploading images, PDFs, Office files, Markdown, HTML, and common text files as workspace attachments.

### Changed
- Unified desktop app runtime data under `~/.nexus`; macOS and Windows no longer use separate `Application Support/Nexus` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nexus` locations.
- Changed chat attachments to pass structured metadata instead of appending file lists or excerpts to the message body. DM/Room pending queues and history replay now preserve attachment metadata, and Room attachments upload to conversation-level public directories.
- File tools now write structured workspace file artifacts after successful execution and expose a one-click open entry in chat.

### Fixed
- Fixed macOS desktop smoke tests treating `/login` as a startup failure when the app was not logged in.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Added Room owner configuration during Room creation and management, with an option for unmentioned public messages to be handled by the owner by default before replying or delegating to members.
- Added a macOS app build job to GitHub Release publishing, uploading dmg, sha256, and metadata assets to the same tag release.
- Added CI-friendly macOS desktop smoke fallback through launcher distributed notifications and configurable fallback reveal tolerance.
- Added a macOS app QA checklist and diagnostics for WebView external links/blocking, launcher close reasons, and WebContent termination.
- Added Makefile targets for macOS app development, build, run, smoke, and packaging.
- Added the Nexus concept app icon to the macOS desktop `.app` bundle.

### Changed
- Redesigned the sidebar chat workspace so contacts, capability entries, recent conversations, and the launcher console have clearer information architecture.
- Changed macOS app default launch and `nexus://launcher` to open the main window full launcher home, removed the separate compact launcher overlay, disabled the default `Option + Space` global wake shortcut, and removed launcher shortcut configuration from settings.

### Fixed
- Fixed Room slot state concurrent access risks and stabilized Room async cleanup tests.
- Fixed `nexus-server --help` triggering migrations too early.
- Fixed chat sidebar tab active state being lost after route changes.
- Fixed running macOS app instances not waking the launcher when opened again.
- Corrected macOS smoke validation for the default launcher route so startup and URL wake-up both land on `/`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Added Nexus version display: release packages inject version, Git commit, and build time; `/system/version` returns current binary information; and Web settings link to GitHub Release downloads.
- Added Windows release package run instructions covering Claude Code, PowerShell, WinGet, and Git for Windows installation paths.

### Changed
- Agent workspace directories now use `agent_id`; renaming an Agent no longer moves the directory and only updates the database name and workspace `AGENTS.md` identity.
- Improved Windows compatibility for workspace initialization by adding a `nexusctl.cmd` entry and mirroring Claude Skill directories when directory symlinks are unavailable.
- Marked onboarding as read immediately when skipped to prevent the same tour from appearing repeatedly.

### Fixed
- Fixed release package launcher "Enter Workspace" clicks staying on the Launcher page.
- Fixed Agent renames failing on Windows when the workspace directory was in use.
- Fixed incomplete SQLite URL expansion for `~` and Windows path separators, and fixed database open failures when the SQLite parent directory did not exist.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Made release packages directly runnable: Linux and Windows runtime packages include the server, frontend assets, database migrations, and built-in Skills, and can serve Nexus through one local address after startup.
- Completed the image-generation capability with a dedicated image-generation Provider, built-in `imagegen` Skill, and in-conversation image result previews.
- Enhanced Room collaboration actions with private-domain messages, requests for specific members to reply, small-audience delivery, delayed wake-up, and room-level Skill rules.
- Completed the first internal validation stage for desktop: local sidecar, standalone window, desktop session credentials, startup diagnostics, and internal validation packages now have a closed loop.

### Fixed
- Made session running state rely on actually running tasks, reducing cases where conversations remained "active" after abnormal exit or failed interruption.
- Room deletion now cleans up members, sessions, messages, and execution records to avoid residual data affecting later use.
- Private-domain Room action sender identity is injected by runtime to prevent model-side spoofing or mistaken sender values.
- Private-domain actions no longer echo body text in tool results by default, reducing collaboration-process information leakage.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Added pending send queues to DM and Room inputs: when a conversation is running or already has queued messages, Enter enqueues new input, and queue items support manual guidance, deletion, and drag sorting.
- Added user-level default message behavior and default new-Agent permission mode to General settings. Default message behavior supports queue/interrupt only, and preferences are written to workspace JSON without adding database tables.
- Preserved the AskUserQuestion interaction channel in bypass permission mode while automatically allowing other tools.
- Replaced stale full session eviction with hot updates for conversation configuration: permission mode and model can switch in place, while changes that require reconnecting, such as cwd or MCP servers, are marked pending reconnect and applied automatically on the next request.
- Added Agent workspace Skill management, including installed Skill display, removal, and removal confirmation to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Improved scheduled-task flow with Agent selection and delivery count refresh.
- Added IM channel and pairing management with channel CRUD, pairing binding, and runtime plumbing, marked as unreleased preview.
- Unified backend API paths under `/nexus/v1`.
- Added Markdown preview/edit mode switching to the editor panel.
- Added `task_started` system message support with backend formatting and frontend presentation.

### Changed
- Removed inline "queue / guide / interrupt" choices from the input box; default message behavior is now controlled in General settings, and guidance remains only as a manual action on pending queue items.
- Reorganized General settings into Appearance, General, and Permissions sections with tighter copy and controls; preferences save immediately after selection, and permission settings are consolidated into four permission-mode dropdown choices.
- Changed DM and Room "guide" behavior into persistent queue state: guided items no longer disappear on click and are consumed only when the corresponding round's PostToolUse hook actually injects them.
- Replayed guidance message history from Claude transcript `hook_additional_context` instead of writing it into the overlay as a duplicate source of truth.
- Room public messages that mention a currently replying Agent no longer force-interrupt that Agent; busy targets receive extra context through SDK streaming input, while idle targets still start a new round normally.
- Room public context is now delivered as per-member cursor increments; fixed collaboration rules go into the SDK append system prompt, while per-round dynamic input keeps only public increments and a one-line natural-language trigger.
- DM conversations can accept additional input while replying, and new messages enqueue into the current streaming conversation instead of killing the active task by default.
- Simplified code block styling by removing red/yellow/green dots, reducing border radius, changing copy buttons to icon-only, and using horizontal scrolling instead of automatic line wrapping.
- Standardized frontend function and prop naming to snake_case across 126 files.
- Split frontend directories by feature domain, refining `types`, `hooks`, `lib`, `features`, and `workspace` into subdomains.

### Security
- Redacted SDK debug log content.

### Fixed
- Fixed guidance queues being consumed too early when the current round had no tool call, making messages neither injected nor visible.
- Fixed DM/Room rounds being treated as prematurely closed when the SDK returned no `result` but the assistant had already completed with `end_turn`.
- Fixed Room public follow-up context missing complete assistant replies without SDK `result`, and fixed manual guidance queue items being overwritten by public increments.
- Fixed guidance queues getting stuck under certain conditions.
- Fixed stuck DM streaming output.
- Added stronger diagnostics for Room round stream interruptions.
- Fixed database migrations not running automatically on service startup.
- Fixed a heartbeat state data race during concurrent access.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Refined the Room public collaboration mechanism with a `room-collaboration` system Skill, public `@` mention wake-up, follow-up `@` triggers after Agent public replies, and no-reply marker output filtering.
- Added personal avatar settings that reuse Agent avatar assets and synchronize avatars to profiles and login status.

### Changed
- Switched frontend and Docker deployment to pnpm: added `pnpm-lock.yaml`, removed `package-lock.json`, and updated the makefile, Web build image, runtime image, and in-container toolchain registry configuration.
- Changed Room public context to inject only public user messages and other Agents' final public results into Agents, no longer including tool calls, thinking, tool results, and other intermediate process data in other members' context.
- Restored Room input behavior to only restrict Agents that are currently replying; normal messages can still be sent while other Agents reply, and the Room Thread panel no longer closes automatically when result messages arrive.
- Allowed Agent renames that only change letter casing while still blocking truly duplicate names.

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker multi-stage builds where concurrent apt cache reuse could seize `/var/cache/apt/archives/lock` and fail installation.
- Fixed Docker builds where Corepack fetched pnpm metadata from npmmirror and received 404; builds now install a fixed pnpm version through npm.
- Fixed token usage data missing from settings when SDK JSON number types caused usage posting to be treated as empty.
- Fixed personal avatars not displaying in DM, the Room main message area, and Room Thread user messages, and ensured avatar changes trigger message item rerenders.
- Fixed Room rounds filtered by no-reply markers not writing token usage ledger entries.
- Fixed missing public results in Room public context injection and intermediate process data leaking into other Agents' inputs.
- Fixed new Room public messages interrupting the whole round by shared session; now only the explicitly mentioned target Agent is stopped.
- Fixed active Room interruption causing an early SDK stream close to be misclassified as a `round stream closed before terminal` error.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Landed the Go backend mainline with `nexus-server`, `nexus-migrate`, `nexusctl`, protocol generation, Goose migrations, and layered `gateway / protocol / runtime / chat / room / session / workspace / skills / connectors / automation` architecture.
- Added browser login and multi-user support with HttpOnly Cookie sessions, server-side session revocation, user-level main Agents, and data isolation for workspaces, rooms, sessions, Skills, and connectors.
- Upgraded DM/Room conversation flows with `transcript + overlay / transcript_ref` history as the source of truth, a shared round execution kernel, multi-observer single-controller execution, Room reconnect recovery, and permission-directed dispatch.
- Added the Capability area with a persistent Skill marketplace, structured scheduled task API/UI/MCP tools, heartbeat/cron automation runtime, GitHub Connector OAuth self-configuration, and `nexus_connectors` MCP tools.
- Expanded workspace and external entry points with workspace live subscriptions, file resource blocks, Discord/Telegram channel entries, and main UI capabilities for Agents, Contacts, Rooms, Settings, Scheduled Tasks, and Connectors.
- Upgraded deployment with Go multi-stage Docker images, an nginx gateway, production health checks, GitHub Release workflow, Agent toolchain bundled in runtime images, and Docker owner bootstrap.

### Changed
- Switched default development, build, migration, validation, and release flows to the Go backend; `make dev`, `make db-init`, `make check`, Docker, and release workflows now run around the current Go mainline.
- Refined gateway and business structure: HTTP handlers are split by domain, shared middleware moved into `gateway/shared`, and DM/Room/ingress/automation/WebSocket inbound routing is coordinated by `Dispatcher`.
- Consolidated session and history models: runtime no longer depends on the legacy `messages.jsonl` body path, session and room directories now use readable semantic paths, and history reads are bounded by Claude transcript and Nexus overlay.
- Made `nexusctl` Agent-friendly with global `--json`, `--pretty`, and `--verbose`, separated stdout/stderr responsibilities, unified success/error structures, and added `--password-stdin`.
- Reorganized the frontend around a unified same-origin API client, WebSocket binding semantics, conversation identity, runtime state machine, page-level controllers, and fuller onboarding/help entry points.
- Aligned automation tool parameters with the UI: `schedule`, `execution_mode`, `reply_mode`, agent scope, cron lookback, and lenient defaults now map to an editable and auditable task model.
- Updated documentation for the current architecture, including README, env examples, deployment notes, and reduced specs for session keys, permission runtime, main Agent, message processing, Skills, Rooms, and frontend design.

### Fixed
- Fixed runtime client invalidation, provider/model hot updates, `bypassPermissions` permission handling, tool parameter error display, file path display, SDK dependency prechecks, and Docker Skill root directory resolution.
- Fixed DM/Room inconsistencies around permission confirmation, stop generation, AskUserQuestion, multi-window observation, reconnect recovery, active-state detection, and input-box state.
- Fixed missing `nexus-manager` / `nexusctl` scope in multi-user deployments to avoid cross-user reads or operations on Agents, Rooms, sessions, workspaces, and Skills.
- Fixed local migrations, Alembic multi-head state, legacy auth-domain structure, Go migration detection, frontend dependency installation, and release workflows still referencing the old Python path.
- Fixed security and concurrency issues including Zip Slip path traversal, token timing side channels, sensitive configuration redaction, Resp global singleton mutation, bare `except`, and exception variable reference errors.

### Removed
- Removed the old Python runtime path, legacy sync/backfill, historical migration CLI, old workspace runtime layout migrations, cost-ledger backfills, and several old-field compatibility paths.
- Removed `messages.jsonl` as a runtime body source of truth, along with old session double-writes, old base64/short-hash directory layouts, and old result projection migrations.
- Removed the old frontend conversation store, home conversation controller, manual loading state, old StreamingCursor component, and stale Session/Workspace helper structures.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Fixed Markdown ordered lists rendering numbers and body text as separate lines in the message area, so content no longer breaks unexpectedly after `1.`.

### Changed
- Unified the main frontend visual style, moving the chat workspace, sidebar, status bar, input area, and empty states to one soft-neumorphic design language.
- Unified internal message block styling so `thinking`, tool execution blocks, Q&A blocks, code blocks, and message statistics share concentric radii and consistent panel hierarchy.
- Unified configuration and confirmation dialog styles so `AgentOptions`, permission confirmations, and confirm/input dialogs match the main UI.
- Refined radius, borders, and shadow rhythm for remaining task overlays, Markdown tables, and related components to reduce visual fragmentation.
- Added SQLite ORM models and an initial Alembic migration for `Agent / Profile / Runtime / Room / Conversation / Session`, establishing the new in-app collaboration data skeleton.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Fixed Agent deletion only archiving records without reclaiming workspace directories and active sessions, leaving old workspaces behind.
- Fixed `thinking` blocks disappearing after later assistant snapshots arrived; thinking blocks now remain stable in the same message round.
- Fixed `tool_result` being split into standalone assistant bubbles; tool results now render back inside the corresponding assistant segment.

### Changed
- Rewrote the backend message processor into a thinner `ChatMessageProcessor + AssistantSegment + SdkMessageMapper` structure aligned to the SDK's actual message rhythm.
- Tightened frontend streaming boundaries so only `thinking / text` participate in `StreamMessage` incremental rendering, while tool calls and tool results use full message snapshots.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Fixed delayed frontend display caused by a second typewriter animation over `thinking` and text streaming content, restoring immediate rendering from backend chunks.
- Fixed unstable ordering when assistant segments closed, tool results were inserted, and the same `message_id` was updated in the message streaming path.
- Fixed frontend errors in `TodoWrite` extraction, session deletion, and workspace sidebar rendering for empty blocks or empty `session_key` cases.

### Changed
- Refactored message protocol boundaries by adding `StreamMessage` and unifying backend streaming messages, final messages, and frontend consumption models.
- Adjusted WebSocket/IM sending layers to explicitly separate `message`, `stream`, and `event` transports.
- Passed `include_partial_messages` to the SDK by default and removed invalid frontend streaming/round configuration options.
